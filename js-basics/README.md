7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined'

Null is an assignment value. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value and is empty.
Undefined is when we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it(define it), the variable becomes undefined.

Null is a type of object.
The data type of undefined is undefined.
When we perform arithmetic operations on null, the value gets converted to 0, and then the further operations get performed. When we perform arithmetic operations on undefined, it prints NaN as the value is undefined and not a number.
